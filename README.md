Simulating eco-evolutionary dynamics in mutualistic networks

In this repository we make available the code for the eco-evolutionary model simulations developed as part of the paper:

**Structural stability predicts evolutionary stability in mutualistic model ecosystems**

Authors: Miguel Lurgi & Alberto Pascual-Garc√≠a

Dependencies:

The ecological model and simulations are implemented as as fortran package that must be downloaded and added to the working path of the R script provided here. This fortran package provides de routines to run the ecological dynamics of the simulations and is through R. The package can be found here: https://github.com/apascualgarcia/RatioDependent

This repository contains scipts implementing the numerical simulations as well as the routines develop to plot and present the results.
